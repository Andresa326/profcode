<h1> Adele - Rolling in The Deep</h1>
<audio src="adele.mp3"controls></audio>
<br><br>
There's a fire starting in my heart <br>
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark<br>
Finally I can see you crystal clear <br>
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare<br>
<br>
See how I'll leave with every piece of you<br>
Don't underestimate the things that I will do<br>
There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark<br>
<br>
The scars of your love remind me of us<br>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br>
The scars of your love they leave me breathless<br>
I can't help feeling <br>
<br>
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)<br>
(Never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)<br>
(Rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)<br>
Of your hands (never had met me)<br>
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)<br>
To the beat (rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
Baby, I have no story to be told <br>
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn <br>
Think of me in the depths of your despair<br>
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared<br>
<br>
(You're gonna wish you)<br>
The scars of your love (never had met me)<br>
Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)<br>
They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)<br>
That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)<br>
The scars of your love (never had met me)<br>
They leave me breathless (tears are gonna fall)<br>
I can't help feeling (rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)<br>
(Never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)<br>
(Rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)<br>
Of your hands (never had met me)<br>
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)<br>
To the beat (rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
We could've had it all<br>
Rolling in the deep<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>
But you played it with a beating<br>
Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)<br>
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)<br>
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)<br>
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
<br>
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)<br>
(Never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)<br>
(Rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)<br>
Of your hands (never had met me)<br>
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)<br>
To the beat (rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)<br>
(Never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)<br>
(Rolling in the deep)<br>
<br>
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)<br>
Of your hands (never had met me)<br>
But you played it, you played it, you played it<br>
You played it to the beat<br>

<br><br>
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through<br>
I just can't say I don't love you<br>
'Cause I love you, yeah<br>
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br>
But tonight I'm gon' let you know<br>
Let me tell the truth<br>
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br>
<br>
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night<br>
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
And I know that you're worth it<br>
I can't walk away, oh!<br>
<br>
Even though we're going through it<br>
And it makes you feel alone<br>
Just know that I would die for you<br>
Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
The distance and the time between us<br>
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
I would die for you<br>
Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
<br>
I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through<br>
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you<br>
Just don't blame me, too, yeah<br>
'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
And you won't find no one that's better<br>
'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
I think I'm right for you, babe<br>
<br>
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
And I know that you're worth it<br>
I can't walk away, oh!<br>
<br>
Even though we're going through it<br>
And it makes you feel alone<br>
Just know that I would die for you<br>
Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
The distance and the time between us<br>
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
I would die for you<br>
Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
<br>
I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na<br>
<br>
Even though we're going through it<br>
And it makes you feel alone<br>
Just know that I would die for you<br>
Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
The distance and the time between us<br>
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby<br>
I would die for you<br>
Baby, I would die for you, yeah babe<br>
(Die for you)<br>
